# Lights ✨, Cameras 🎥, Insights📈

## Project by Chris Addeo ✍️

### Intro:
The cover story 📝 for this project is that I am working for a major entertainment corporation that is trying to get a better handle on both what makes a good movie as well as a better understanding of the viewers ✅. 

Historically, this process was mostly guided by intuition 🤔, but is increasingly infused by data based decision making 📊. This is where I – a budding data scientist – come in. Can I do better than intuition? How will I provide this media company with valuable 💸, actionable insights 🙌🏻?

### Goals 🥅:
* Learn about consumer spending habits 💳💲 
    * Do you prefer online or in person shopping?
    * How likely are you to spend money on an advert?
    * Do you like splurging on quality/pleasure or just getting what you need?


* Learn about consumer personality factors 🎭🧘
    * Are you introverted or extroverted?
    * Do you like to watch media solo or with friends?
    * Are you a risk taker or like to play it safe?
    * Do you procrastinate or get things done right away?


* Understand the intersection of media, consumer personality, and consumer spending 🧠💫
    * What type of genres does this personality type enjoy?
    * How do we appeal to specific personality traits?
    * Which genres have a reliable fanbase?
    * How much do certain personalities spend?


* **Can I predict movie preference based on personality?** 🔮
* **Can I predict personality based on movie preference?** 🧙‍♀️

* Have some fun!🪄
    * Are there interesting insights and divisions that can be found through using statistics and machine learning?


### Dataset Description 🎯:
This dataset features <u>**ratings**</u> 📊 of <u>**400 movies**</u>🍿 from <u>**1097 participants**</u> 🙋🏽‍♂️. It is organized as follows 🌐 :
* 1st row: **Headers** (Movie titles/questions) –note that the indexing in this list is from 1 
* Row 2-1098: Responses from individual **participants**
* Columns 1-400: These columns contain the ratings for the 400 **movies** (0 to 4, and missing)
* Columns 401-420: These columns contain self-assessments on **sensation-seeking behaviors** (1-5)
* Columns 421-464: These columns contain responses to **personality questions** (1-5)
* Columns 465-474: These columns contain self-reported **movie-experience ratings** (1-5)
* Column 475: **Gender identity** (1 = female, 2 = male, 3 = self-described)
* Column 476: **Only child** (1 = yes, 0 = no, -1 = no response)
* Column 477: **Social-viewing preference**–“movies are best enjoyed alone”(1 = y, 0 = n, -1 = nr)
